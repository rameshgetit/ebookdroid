Notes
====================

Sources are big to ensure no pixelation occur during creation. Pixel size of page are multiple of 8.

To create a button: create a copy of iconfolder.svg
Open to edit, add content (by importing svg graphics or by editing them on the spot). 
This will ensure the button outline will be the same for all icons.



Things to do:
==============

Add dark border to folders (they look a little pale)
Align button content to a common baseline
Redo magnifying glass icons
	for quick zoom ---> add ruler under the lens
	for text search ---> add a "T" under the lens
	for book search ---> add a book back under the lens
Absolutely redo the triangle in outline view!!! They are too big and obtrusive.



Possible eyecandy enhancements
==============================
Do we really need 'unframed' actionbar icons? What about making all icons framed?

Reversing gradient of action bar background. Right now (vers. 1.5.3 dev 1447) the gradient is such as to present a discontinuity near the top black bar of the device and a fading to black toward Ebookdroid area. In this way the first black row in filebrowse mode looks bigger then the other ones.

Also, reducing the height and removing gradient coloring from the rows of the outline could greatly improve its appearance without noticeably hindering navigation (users will tap on text).
